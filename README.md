# Industrial-UWB-localization-CIR-dataset
Industrial UWB localization dataset containing Channel Impulse Response data (CIRs).

## Dataset description
This dataset contains CIRs from 23 different positions in an industrial environment, as illustrated in the picture below.

These originate from a tag-anchor pair configured with two-way-ranging for distance estimations. In total, 21 anchors are placed in the area, allowing both Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-LOS (NLOS) signal propagation, as illustrated below.
